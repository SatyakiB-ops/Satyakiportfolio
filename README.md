## 🚀 Projects

### 📈 Volatility Dynamics in Indian Financial Markets
This research focuses on modeling the volatility of the Nifty 50 index over a 15-year period. I employed advanced econometric techniques such as EGARCH and the Markov Switching Model to capture regime shifts in market volatility. To explore macroeconomic influences, I incorporated six key indicators, including CPI, exchange rate, and crude oil prices, and analyzed both short- and long-run dynamics through ARDL modeling. Wavelet analysis was also applied to detect the time-varying impact of these macroeconomic factors on volatility. The project provided a comprehensive understanding of how external shocks and policy uncertainties drive market fluctuations in India.  

### 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
In this project, I developed a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from highly imbalanced data. Using techniques like over-sampling and SMOTE-Tomek for class balancing, I trained an ensemble model combining XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 99% and a precision–recall score of 93%, outperforming conventional methods. I also carried out exploratory data analysis and visualized transaction patterns to highlight behavioral differences between legitimate and fraudulent activities. This project demonstrates how robust modeling and preprocessing strategies can be used to tackle real-world fraud detection problems.  

### 📊 Nifty 50 Closing Price Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis
This work involves forecasting daily closing prices of the NIFTY 50 index using ARIMA models implemented in Python with the statsmodels and pmdarima libraries. Historical data was obtained from Yahoo Finance, and model performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The ARIMA-based forecasts achieved an error of less than 5%, indicating strong reliability for short-term market trend predictions. The project highlights the usefulness of time series analysis for financial forecasting and decision-making in equity markets.  

### 🌍 Macroeconomics Time Series Analysis Using VAR Modelling
This project explores the long-run relationship between per capita GDP and consumption in Pakistan through econometric time series modeling. Using Johansen cointegration tests, I established the presence of a long-term equilibrium relationship. A Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was then estimated, followed by Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) to study how shocks in GDP impact consumption patterns. Results showed that shocks persisted up to five periods, providing valuable insights into consumption dynamics in a developing economy. The project demonstrates the power of VAR-based modeling in uncovering economic interdependencies.
